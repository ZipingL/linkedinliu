# Getting Started with LinkedinLiu as a Create React App

## Build your own LinkedIn, like Ziping did when Ziping got banned from LinkedIn.

__Setup your own LinkedIn at Home, with this repo as a template__, and have your own LinkedIn proudly Homegrown, 100% self-made profile in no time, *as a quick and easy way to display your OG linkedin profile, __but without fear__ of LinkedIn Legal deleting or retricting your content!* Because, wow, I guess __*you probably never heard of someone getting banned on LinkedIn before*__ and given that it's such a rare thing to be seen, you *probably are thinking: Wow Ziping, you must of done something very severe*, and consequential! ZIPING YOU MUST BE Such a CONTROVERSIAL person!



## Background

 - Why did Ziping get banned from LinkedIn? Exactly how does one even get banned from LinkedIn? Why is that even a thing? Everything on LinkedIn is just corporate advertisements and people pretending to compliment each other. It's even more of a likes' contest than Facebook or Twitter, especially since, you connect with people you never even met before, you just connect with each other to increase each other's connections' count.
 - Ziping got banned because he wrote a commented on an advertisement on LinkedIn.
   - He wrote, "Help me, I am being corporate retaliated against."
   - The advertisement was for a criminal law firm.
 - Strangely enough Ziping Liu promptly got banned.
 - Ziping Liu did not do anything else different during the past few weeks, other than, for the first time, explicitly write the words "corporate retaliation" and moreover: this was the first time Ziping Liu wrote it towards something related to some legal entity other than Amazon Legal.
 - Ziping Liu then asked LinkedIn, why did Ziping Liu have his LinkedIn restricted, or in other words, banned, because LinkedIn clarified to him:
   - LinkedIn Support: your account is permannelty restricted due occuring violations against our policies that goes against our professional community guidlines. At this point in time we can not un-restrict your account.
   - This is probably the oddest way to sugar coat a restriction that unfortunately, had very much to do with the action that Ziping took, rather than this excuse given. 
   - LinkedIn is not exactly the best place to do mischievious things, such as catfish people, or scam people, given: you don't really use LinkedIn to advertise your OnlyFans,
   - LinkedIn is failed to acknowledge my historical presence on the platform for at least six years, and basically treated my account as if it was brand new, created a day ago, and thus without credibility 
     - My LinkedIn account was rated as "all-star" status. But all jokes allside, it was not an "empty" looking LinkedIn Account. It was actually filled with content, and endorsements; I'm not trying to brag about my stupid fucking LinkedIn account, i'm describing how my account was not at all the type you would treat as a "permanent restriction" for reasons only referred to as "violation of policies." The irony here is, they stated how LinkedIn's policies is to ensure a professional community, but yet fails to acknowledge my profile as actually with, as stated above, professional standing content. 
     
LinkedIn never explicitly explained why the restriction was permanent, stating: repeated violations, as reason is the same as, violating conditions. LinkedIn did not at all refer to the other times violated, nor does LinkedIn have a counter system that actually uses some sort of frequency based restriction system: which is what some platforms use such as YouTube. But LinkedIn does not at all need to use such an automated form of restriction processes given: YouTube caters to accounts that do not exaclty have to showcase a person, and given how it is a video streaming platform, they do in fact have issues with accounts repeated violating copyright violations. 
 - Technically, stating amount of violations, and without further descriptive clauses, is the same as stating: violating terms and conditions one or many times. Technically, having an account restricted may well be from more than one violation found. Moreover, repeated violations, if measured by severity, would then measure the number of times an account has been restricted as form of repeated violations. LinkedIn did not at all refer to my violations, as, due to multiple restrictions of my LinkedIn Account, but rather: due to violations of policies.
   - It is important to note that violations based on restriction of account in my context would actually not work. This is because I was actually being targeted online, and reported, by Amazon affiliates, who saw my LinkedIn Account as a threat to their image.
   - My account was reported a number of times by Amazon associates with intentions of having my LinkedIn account restricted, this is due to my LinkedIn Profiles's, as stated before: large outreach towards a professional audience due to the content, and connections that my profile displayed. As stated: my profile was by no means, anywhere close to being an "empty" profile or "average" one. 
 
 
#### Amazon Legal won that battle. ON August 15th, 
After I had posted a LinkedIn Job Position for my press organization, my account was restricted, after, I had commented on a law firm's ad, about corporate retaliation as well.
 - I had posted a job position a week prior, and, to my suprise, I had over fifty applicants. Moreover, publicity of my organization, and current investigations against Amazon Legal, skyrocketed as the job application made an impressive public impression, that was not seen by any other my other forms internet outreach.
 - I had not done much at all in terms of networking, sharing, or publicizing my investigation. I was not at all really knowledgeable in press relations, and simply ignored that aspect. However, the job posting made me realize how impactful strategic PR moves could be.
 - Unfortunately, LinkedIn PR team knew exactly what has happening, and made swift moves, under Amazon Legal's orders, to ban my account. 

I ulimately lost a huge public medium, because my profile, as stated, actually held thousands of connections, and I was actually being messaged by companies that wanted to parnter with my organization, everyday. 
 - After losing my account, and hence, the result being that those I had been in contact with via the platform, suddenly seeing a "cartoon figure" as a profile picture, and "Linkedin User" as the name, instantly made me lose credibility to the public, given, that means my LinkedIn account got restricted, and given that I had not returned, nor had been able to return, to the platform since September 17th then would imply to the public that I was in fact some sort of charlatan, or scammer.
 
Unfortunately, I'm not. and Unfortunately< i then moved to Twitter.com, where I had my Twiter Account, established 2010, (13 years ago), and began to use that as my new soapbox. This was in fact a huge benefit on my end given, Tweets are easily shareable, and are recorded almost like an audit entry or journal entry. I had not known how incredible Twitter had become with it's feature packed api that allows tweets to simply be displayed, anywhere, and in any kind of presentation. 

So, yeah, my LinkedIn Account banned basically led to an explosion in publicity of my reports and analysis released, detalailing of corporate retaliation against Amazon. As you can see from [here](https://amazonservers.cn) and [here](https://ercaws.com/about), the result of moving towards Twitter as my platform led to a 5000 percent jump in impressions accross the internet.



Anyways, sorry for the long ass story. So in case your LinkedIn Account get's banned to, feel free to make your own HomeGrown LinkedIn Account as well using repo as inspiration. That way, if your linkedin get's banned, you have your LinkedIn profile, and its content, still at home. 

For instance, I now have a LinkedIn at Home, and on the web, and in case the web profile is deleted by LinkedIn, I still have my LinkedIn at home!


## FAQ

### Your repos do not explain your code structure well, nor give any kind of guide on how to utilize it, are you assuming that we can instantly just look through your spaghetti written code, and suddenly become just as regressed in cognitive ability as yourself to comprehend the type of lower formed logic, showcased your code?
 - Good point. Yes, this is not explained clearly. But indeed there well be an expansive, documentation, as well as repo cleanup of unnecessary files or oddly written code for repo's like this one. As for now, please make do with searching stuff on google or evening emailing dev@ziping.life. Documentation, well, specifically: useful documentation, takes actual planning and time to write out. **The very last thing** I want is to write out some documenational guides on coding that actually is wrong, or guides that do not make any sense at all. *If you search on the web for questions on your code,  you may have found not all guides on programming, or How-To articles, are written at the same level of usefulness. Some don't make sense at all.*
 - I plan on creating a web development course given how I find useful guides on web dev few and far between on the internet, and hopefully to be first released as wiki guides [here](https://myamazon.legal). 
    - As you can tell, Amazon Legal has taken up my bandwidth, and my website hosting spaces, due to their incessant need on continuing their idiocy and forcing me to postpone other goals in my life with actual value, and meaning, because: as much as Amazon legal wants to think of them as special, or badasses, for doing such hardcore, retaliatory actions, its very stupid, childish, and at this point: my involvement with Amazon legal is basically me attempting to spoon feed an idea as simple as artihmetic, that is not at all being recieved nor understood, with zero progress made, now, given, an attempted time frame, of exactly a year, divided by half.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
